AI Usage (Claude & Codex)

I used Claude and Codex for the following tasks:

Generating backend code for Spring Boot (CRUD endpoints, analytics APIs, categorization engine, rule-based logic, feedback tracking)

Generating Angular components and services (transaction list, add/edit forms, filters, dashboard, charts)

Creating Flyway migrations, JPA entities, repositories, and service logic

Producing unit tests and skeleton integration tests

Writing documentation files (architecture, PRD shard documents, UI/UX notes)

Generating helper files such as prompts.md and codex-prompts.md

Accepted vs. Modified Output

I accepted nearly all generated code directly without manual edits.

I did not modify the generated folder structure, DTOs, services, controllers, repositories, Angular components, or styling files.

No manual fixes, debugging, or refactoring were required on my side.

Impact of AI on Speed & Code Quality

AI accelerated the development dramatically, especially for large and repetitive tasks.

End-to-end story implementation (backend + frontend + tests) allowed very fast progress across all project epics.

The generated code was consistent, well-structured, and aligned with the PRD and BMAD planning documents.

Custom Settings

I did not use any custom AI settings.

All work was done with default Claude Code and Codex configuration.

Problems Encountered

I did not have enough time to install Docker and Testcontainers, so integration tests could not be executed locally.

Despite that, all necessary integration test files were generated and included in the repository.

The overall development flow remained uninterrupted and all required features were completed with AI assistance.
