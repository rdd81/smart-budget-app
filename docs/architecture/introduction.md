# Introduction

This document outlines the complete full-stack architecture for the Smart Budget App, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern full-stack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Greenfield project - built from scratch

No starter templates are used. The project is built using standard Angular CLI (`ng new`) and Spring Initializr for Spring Boot, with custom configuration to match our specific architectural needs.
