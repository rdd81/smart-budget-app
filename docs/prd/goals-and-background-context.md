## Background Context

Smart Budget App addresses a critical gap in personal finance management for budget-conscious individuals who struggle with unclear spending patterns and cumbersome tracking methods. Current solutions either require significant manual effort (spreadsheets), lack analytical depth (basic banking apps), or overwhelm users with complexity (enterprise financial software). Our target users—primarily young professionals aged 22-35—want to understand where their money goes without becoming accountants.

The application combines intuitive transaction management with AI-powered categorization and visual analytics to transform raw financial data into meaningful insights. By focusing on web-first delivery with a mobile-responsive design, we ensure accessibility across all devices without installation barriers. The MVP prioritizes core transaction tracking, categorization, and visualization features while deliberately excluding banking integration, multi-user sharing, and advanced AI recommendations to maintain focus and accelerate time-to-market within the 8-12 week development timeline.
