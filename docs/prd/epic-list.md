# Epic List

The Smart Budget App MVP will be delivered through 4 sequential epics, each building upon the previous to deliver complete, deployable functionality:

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**
Establish project structure, development environment, CI/CD pipeline, database setup, and basic authentication to create a solid foundation for all subsequent features while delivering a functional login/registration system.

**Epic 2: Transaction Management**
Implement complete transaction lifecycle (create, read, update, delete) with category assignment, enabling users to record and manage their financial data as the core functionality of the application.

**Epic 3: Dashboard & Visual Analytics**
Build the summary dashboard with aggregated financial data and interactive charts, transforming raw transaction data into actionable visual insights that help users understand their spending patterns.

**Epic 4: AI-Powered Categorization**
Add intelligent transaction categorization with suggestion engine and learning from user feedback, reducing manual effort and demonstrating the "smart" value proposition of the application.
