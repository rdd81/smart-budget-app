# Checklist Results Report

## PM Checklist Execution

**Checklist:** pm-checklist.md

**Execution Status:** ✅ Completed

**Results:**

✅ **Goals Section Complete:** Goals clearly articulate desired outcomes for users and the project, focusing on transaction tracking, AI categorization, visual insights, and BMAD methodology validation.

✅ **Background Context Complete:** Background provides concise summary of problem statement, target users, and MVP scope from Project Brief without redundancy.

✅ **Change Log Initialized:** Change log table created with initial entry documenting PRD creation.

✅ **Functional Requirements Defined:** 20 functional requirements specified covering authentication, transaction CRUD, categorization, dashboard summaries, visualizations, and filtering.

✅ **Non-Functional Requirements Defined:** 20 non-functional requirements specified covering performance, security, compatibility, testing, architecture, and code quality standards.

✅ **Requirements Traceable:** Each requirement can be traced to stories in epics and linked to acceptance criteria.

✅ **UI Design Goals Documented:** Comprehensive UI/UX section defines vision, interaction paradigms, core screens, accessibility (WCAG AA), branding guidelines, and responsive web targets.

✅ **Technical Assumptions Documented:** Complete technical stack specified: Angular 17+ frontend, Java 21/Spring Boot backend, PostgreSQL database, monorepo structure, Docker containerization, comprehensive testing strategy.

✅ **Epic List Defined:** 4 epics defined following agile best practices with sequential delivery: Foundation, Transaction Management, Dashboard & Analytics, AI Categorization.

✅ **Epic Sequencing Logical:** Each epic builds upon previous, delivering complete deployable functionality. Epic 1 establishes infrastructure while delivering auth functionality.

✅ **Stories Follow User Story Format:** All stories use "As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit]" format.

✅ **Stories Sequenced Properly:** Stories within each epic follow logical sequence with no forward dependencies.

✅ **Acceptance Criteria Clear and Testable:** All stories include numbered, specific, testable acceptance criteria defining "done."

✅ **Story Sizing Appropriate:** Stories sized for AI agent completion in single focused session (2-4 hour equivalent).

✅ **Cross-Cutting Concerns Addressed:** Logging, security, testing integrated throughout stories rather than deferred to end.

✅ **No Orphaned Requirements:** All functional and non-functional requirements mapped to stories in epics.

⚠️ **Elicitation Performed:** YOLO mode selected - comprehensive draft created for user review. User can request elicitation on any section if desired.

✅ **Next Steps Defined:** Architect and UX expert prompts prepared for handoff to next phase.

**Overall Assessment:** PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for architectural design phase. All BMAD standards followed. Technical stack clearly defined (Angular/Spring Boot). Epic and story breakdown delivers MVP within 8-12 week timeline with logical sequencing.
